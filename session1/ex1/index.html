    <h1 style = "background-color: black; text-align: center; color: white;">John Connor</h1>  
    <h2 style="color:blue">Main</h2>
    <p><span style = "color:red">John Connor</span>, the son of <span style = "font-style: italic; color: blueviolet;">Sarah Connor</span> and Kyle Reese, is the leader of the worldwide human Resistance, as well as <br>
        the more specialised Tech-Com during the War Against the Machines. Skynet, the supercomputer mainframe of the <br>
        machines, decides that <span style = "color:red">John Connor</span> is the focal point of the rebellion and his termination would end the <br>
        opposition. After repeated failures at terminating <span style = "color:red">John</span> during the war, Skynet decides to use a time displacement <br>
        device to send Terminators to various points in the past in an attempt to terminate him before the war even begins.</p>

    <h2 style = "color:blue">Original timeline</h2>
    <p>On the brink of extinction, <span style = "color:red">John Connor</span> united the despairing humans and taught them to fight, storm the camps <br>
        and overcome the Terminator guards. Much of the Resistance was created from these survivors.</p>

    <p><span style = "color:red">John Connor</span> led the human Resistance to the victory in the War against the Machines in the year <span style = "text-decoration: underline;">2029</span>. In order to<br>
        eliminate <span style = "color:red">John Connor</span>, Skynet sent a <span style = "font-style: italic; color:green">T-800</span> and a <span style = "font-style: italic; color:green">T-1000</span> to the past to kill <span style = "color:red">John's</span> mother, <span style = "font-style: italic; color: blueviolet;">Sarah</span>, and young <br>
        <span style = "color:red">John Connor</span> respectively via Time Displacement Equipment. Thus, <span style = "color:red">John</span> sends Kyle Reese, a young soldier, and a <br>
        reprogrammed Series <span style = "font-style: italic; color:red">800</span> Terminator to the past to protect <span style = "font-style: italic; color: blueviolet;">Sarah Connor</span> and young <span style = "color:red">John Connor</span> respectively.</p>

    <h2 style = "color:blue">Alternate timeline</h2>
    <p><span style = "color:red">John Connor</span> was born to <span style = "font-style: italic; color: blueviolet;">Sarah Connor</span> on <span style = "text-decoration: underline;">February 28, 1985</span>. His father, Kyle Reese, had been killed nine months <br>
        prior in <span style = "text-decoration: underline;">May 1984</span>, protecting <span style = "font-style: italic; color: blueviolet;">Sarah</span> from a time-traveling Terminator. <span style = "color:red">John's</span> early life was filled with training by <br>
        various persons his mother <span style = "font-style: italic; color: blueviolet;">Sarah</span> had met as the two lived off the grid after the attempt on her life by the <br>
        Terminator. Much of his training concentrated on the areas of weaponry, computer technology, and espionage.</p>

    <p>When <span style = "font-style: italic; color: blueviolet;">Sarah Connor</span> was shot and captured after trying to blow up a computer factory in the early <span style = "text-decoration: underline;">1990s</span>, <span style = "color:red">John</span> was <br>
        placed into foster care and told that his mother's stories of the future were merely delusions. He was unable to cope <br>
        with life in suburbia and rebelled, edging towards delinquency, turning into a young gangster and receiving a police <br>
        record (which included trespassing, shoplifting, disturbing the peace, and vandalism) by the time he was <span style = "text-decoration: underline;">10 years</span> <br>
        <span style = "text-decoration: underline;">old</span>. His foster parents, Todd and Janelle Voight, found themselves unable to deal with him, and were not surprised <br>
        when a police officer showed up at their door asking to speak with <span style = "color:red">John</span>.</p>

    <h2 style = "color:blue">Deviating timelines</h2>

    <p>Because <span style = "font-style: italic; color: blueviolet;">Sarah</span>, <span style = "color:red">John</span>, and the <span style = "font-style: italic; color:green">T-800</span> successfully destroyed the laboratory of Cyberdyne Systems, Skynet is never <br>
        created and Judgment Day never occurs. In the year <span style = "text-decoration: underline;">2027</span>, <span style = "color:red">John Connor</span> is a U.S. Senator and has a child.</p>
