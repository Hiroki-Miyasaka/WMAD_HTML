                Canada's cities and towns offer travelers a diverse choice of experiences, from chic, cosmopolitan centers to mountain resorts and maritime cities. Determining the best places to 
                visit may depend on your interests and the type of trip you're hoping to create.<br>
                In the heart of the country is Toronto, Canada's biggest city and the highlight of Canada's arts and cultural scene. Nearby, Niagara Falls is a must-see attraction for visitors to 
                Canada that never disappoints. In the neighboring French-speaking province of Qu√©bec, Montreal is known for fashion, culture, and history.<br>
                In the West, Vancouver and Victoria offer two very different perspectives on West Coast cities, but each has something unique to offer. The mountain towns of Whistler and Banff 
                are places to immerse yourself in beautiful mountain scenery and enjoy a little of the great outdoors.
