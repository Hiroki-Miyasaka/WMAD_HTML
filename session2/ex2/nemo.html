                <span class = "mark_orange">Finding Nemo</span> is the best-selling DVD title of all time, with over 40 million copies sold as of <span class="black_border">2006</span>, and was the <br>
                highest-grossing G-rated <span class="blue_border">film</span> of all time before Pixar's own Toy Story 3 overtook it. The <span class="blue_border">film</span> was re-released in 3D in <br>
                <span class="black_border">2012</span>. In <span class="black_border">2008</span>, the American <span class="blue_border">film</span> Institute named it as the 10th greatest American animated <span class="blue_border">film</span> as part of their 10 Top <br>
                10 lists. A sequel, Finding <span class="mark_blue">Dory</span>, was released in June <span class="black_border">2016</span>.ome time later, Marlin is overprotective of <span class = "mark_orange">Nemo</span>, born with <br>
                a stunted right fin. On <span class = "mark_orange">Nemo</span>'s first day of school, Marlin embarrasses <span class = "mark_orange">Nemo</span>, and the two argue. While Marlin is <br>
                talking to <span class = "mark_orange">Nemo</span>'s teacher, <span class = "mark_orange">Nemo</span> defiantly approaches a nearby speedboat, where a pair of scuba divers capture him. <br>
                Marlin pursues the boat in vain and meets <span class="mark_blue">Dory</span>, a blue tang with acute short-term memory loss, who offers her help. <br>
                The two encounter Bruce, Anchor, and Chum, three sharks who have sworn to abstain from eating fish. Marlin <br>
                discovers a diver's mask that fell from the boat; he accidentally hits <span class="mark_blue">Dory</span> with it, giving her a nosebleed. The scent <br>
                sends Bruce into a feeding frenzy, but they flee after accidentally setting off a ring of old naval mines, which knock <br>
                Marlin and <span class="mark_blue">Dory</span> unconscious. <span class = "mark_orange">Nemo</span> is placed in an aquarium in the office of dentist Philip Sherman in Sydney, <br>
                Australia. He meets the "Tank Gang", including yellow tang Bubbles, starfish Peach, cleaner shrimp Jacques, blowfish <br>
                Bloat, royal gramma Gurgle, and twin damselfish Deb and Flo, led by Gill, a Moorish idol. <span class = "mark_orange">Nemo</span> learns he is to be given <br>
                to Sherman's young niece, Darla, who has killed her previous fish. Gill devises a risky escape plan: <span class = "mark_orange">Nemo</span>, who can fit <br>
                inside the aquarium's filter tube, will jam the filter with a pebble, forcing Sherman to put the fish into plastic bags <br>
                while he cleans the tank, allowing them to roll out the window and into the harbor. <span class = "mark_orange">Nemo</span> attempts the maneuver, <br>
                but fails and is almost killed. Marlin and <span class="mark_blue">Dory</span> wake up unharmed, but the mask falls into a deep trench. They descend <br>
                after it and encounter an anglerfish that chases them. <span class="mark_blue">Dory</span> memorizes the address written on the goggles, and they escape. <br>
                <span class="mark_blue">Dory</span> and Marlin receive directions from a school of moonfish, but Marlin disregards them to take what he <br>
                believes is a safer route. They stumble into a forest of jellyfish, the stings of which knock them unconscious. They <br>
                awaken in the East Australian Current with a group of sea turtles, including Crush and his son, Squirt. Marlin tells them <br>
                about his quest, and the story is relayed across the ocean to Sydney, where a pelican, Nigel, tells the Tank Gang. <br>
                Inspired by his father's bravery, <span class = "mark_orange">Nemo</span> makes another attempt to jam the filter and succeeds, and soon the aquarium <br>
                is covered in green algae.

                The inspiration for <span class = "mark_orange">Finding Nemo</span> sprang from multiple experiences, going back to director <span class="blue_border">Andrew Stanton</span>'s <br>
                childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and <br>
                wanted to go home. In <span class="black_border">1992</span>, shortly after his son was born, he and his family took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom <br>
                (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the <br>
                underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation. Later, in <span class="black_border">1997</span>, he took his son for a walk in the <br>
                park but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.
