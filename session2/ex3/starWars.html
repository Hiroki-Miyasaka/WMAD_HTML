            <p>A <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> is a fictional energy sword featured throughout the 
                <span class="star_wars">Star Wars</span> franchise. A typical <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> is depicted
                as a luminescent plasma blade about 3 feet (0.91 m) in length emitted from a metal hilt around 10.5 inches (27 cm)
                in length.[1] First introduced in the original <span class="star_wars">Star Wars</span> film,[a] it has since 
                appeared in most <span class="star_wars">Star Wars</span> films, with at least one <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> 
                duel occurring in each installment of the "Skywalker saga". The <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span>'s distinct 
                appearance was created using rotoscoping for the original films, and with digital effects for the prequel and sequel trilogies.</p>

                As presented in the films, a <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span>'s energy blade can cut, burn, and melt 
                through most substances with little resistance.[4] It leaves cauterized wounds in flesh, but can be deflected 
                by another blade, by energy shields, <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> or by the metal beskar. The blade 
                has even been used as a tool to weld metal. Other times, the <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> has been 
                shown to cause bleeding wounds in the flesh, sometimes accompanied by burns. Some exotic saber-proof melee weapons 
                have been introduced in the Expanded Universe as well as later episodic films. An active <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> 
                gives off a distinctive hum, which rises in pitch and volume as the blade is moved rapidly through the air. Bringing the 
                blade into contact with another <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span>'s blade produces a loud crackle.
