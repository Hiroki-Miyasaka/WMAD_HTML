            <p>A <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> is a fictional energy sword featured throughout the 
                <span class="star_wars">Star Wars</span> franchise. A typical <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> is depicted
                as a luminescent plasma blade about 3 feet (0.91 m) in length emitted from a metal hilt around 10.5 inches (27 cm)
                in length.[1] First introduced in the original <span class="star_wars">Star Wars</span> film,[a] it has since 
                appeared in most <span class="star_wars">Star Wars</span> films, with at least one <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> 
                duel occurring in each installment of the "Skywalker saga". The <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span>'s distinct 
                appearance was created using rotoscoping for the original films, and with digital effects for the prequel and sequel trilogies.</p>

                As presented in the films, a <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span>'s energy blade can cut, burn, and melt 
                through most substances with little resistance.[4] It leaves cauterized wounds in flesh, but can be deflected 
                by another blade, by energy shields, <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> or by the metal beskar. The blade 
                has even been used as a tool to weld metal. Other times, the <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> has been 
                shown to cause bleeding wounds in the flesh, sometimes accompanied by burns. Some exotic saber-proof melee weapons 
                have been introduced in the Expanded Universe as well as later episodic films. An active <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> 
                gives off a distinctive hum, which rises in pitch and volume as the blade is moved rapidly through the air. Bringing the 
                blade into contact with another <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span>'s blade produces a loud crackle.

                For the original <span class="star_wars">Star Wars</span> film, the film prop hilts were constructed by John Stears 
                from old Graflex press camera flash battery packs and other pieces of hardware. The full-sized sword props were 
                designed to appear ignited onscreen, by later creating an "in-camera" glowing effect in post-production. The blade is 
                a three-sided rod which was coated with a Scotchlite retroreflector array, the same sort used for highway signs.[14] A 
                lamp was positioned to the side of the taking camera and reflected towards the subject through 45-degree angled glass 
                so that the sword would appear to glow from the camera's point of view.

                Set decorator Roger Christian found the handles for the Graflex Flash Gun in a photography shop in Great Marlborough 
                Street, in London's West End.[15] He then added cabinet T-track to the handles, securely attaching them with cyanoacrylate 
                glue. Adding a few "greebles" (surface details), Christian managed to hand-make the first prototype of a <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span>
                prop for Luke before production began. George Lucas decided he wanted to add a clip to the handle, so that Luke could hang it on his belt. 
                <span class="special">When all was said and done, Lucas and Spielberg returned the 1970s audience, grown sophisticated on a diet of European and 
                New Hollywood films, to the simplicities of the pre-1960s Golden Age of movies... They marched backward through the 
                looking-glass.</span> Once Lucas felt the handle was up to his standards, it went to John Stears to create the wooden dowel 
                rod with front-projection paint so that the animators would have a glow of light to enhance later on in post production. 
                Due to lack of preparation time, Christian's prototype and a second spare were used for the shooting in Tunisia, where filming 
                on <span class="star_wars">Star Wars</span> began.[16] It was discovered, however, that the glowing effect was greatly dependent on the rod's orientation 
                to the camera, and during the Obi-Wan Kenobi/Darth Vader duel, they could clearly be seen as rods. Because of this, the glow 
                would be added in post-production through rotoscoping, which also allowed for diffusion to be employed to enhance the glow.

                Korean animator Nelson Shin, who was working for DePatie-Freleng Enterprises at the time, was asked by his manager 
                if he could animate the <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> in the live-action scenes of a film. After Shin accepted 
                the assignment, the live-action footage was given to him. He drew the <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> with a 
                rotoscope, an animation which was superimposed onto the footage of the physical <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> 
                blade prop. Shin explained to the people from Lucasfilm that since a <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> is made of 
                light, the sword should look "a little shaky" like a fluorescent tube. He suggested inserting one frame that was much lighter 
                than the others while printing the film on an optical printer, making the light seem to vibrate. Shin also recommended adding 
                a degausser sound on top of the other sounds for the weapon since the sound would be reminiscent of a magnetic field. 
                The whole process took one week, surprising his company. Lucasfilm showed Shin the finished product, having followed his 
                suggestions to use an X-Acto knife to give the <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> a very sharp look, and to have 
                sound accompany the weapon's movements.

                <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span>'s were present in the earliest drafts as mundane plasma weapons that were 
                used alongside laser guns.[21][22] The introduction of the Force in a later revision made the Jedi and the Sith 
                supernaturally skilled; initially they were only portrayed as swordsmen.[23] The <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> 
                became the Force-user's tool, described in A New Hope by Obi-Wan Kenobi as "not as clumsy or random as a blaster. An elegant 
                weapon, for a more civilized age."[24] The source of a <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span>'s power is a kyber crystal.
                [25] These crystals are also the power source of the Death Star's superlaser.

                Since the release of the first film, replicas of <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> have been a popular 
                piece of <span class="star_wars">Star Wars</span> merchandise, ranging from inexpensive plastic toys to the 
                "Force FX" series from Master Replicas, deluxe replicas which use LED-lighted tubes and sound effects to create a 
                close audio-visual representation of what is seen on screen.Disneyland in California sells 
                <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span>-themed churros outside its Star Tours attraction.[45] Disneyland and 
                Disney World (Hollywood Studios) also sell legacy <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> which are replicas 
                of the <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> seen used by the Jedi and Sith in the movies such as Darth Vader, 
                Obi-Wan Kenobi, Rey Skywalker, Count Dooku, and Kylo Ren.[46][47] Disneyland and Hollywood Studios also offer Savi's 
                Workshop, a place where guests can build their own <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> and choose their own 
                kyber crystal, thereby changing the blade color of their own unique <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span>.
                [48][49][50] Besides Savi's Workshop, there is another custom <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> experience. 
                The Star Trader at Disneyland offers guests a chance to build their own <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span>, 
                without first paying 200 dollars for the experience.

                With the advent of motion-controlled video games, players were given the opportunity to wield an in-game 
                <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> with their own hands. In the seventh generation of video game consoles, 
                there were several <span class="star_wars">Star Wars</span> video games available on the Wii (Lego Star Wars: 
                The Complete Saga, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, Star Wars: The Clone Wars - <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> 
                Duels, Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Republic Heroes and Lego <span class="star_wars">Star Wars</span> III: The Clone Wars) 
                and one on the Xbox 360 (Kinect <span class="star_wars">Star Wars</span>) that utilized motion controls to wield a 
                <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span> through arm gestures. Unleashed and Duels, both developed by Krome Studios, have 
                more precise control of the <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span>, allowing players to swing it in any of five 
                different directions (up, down, left, right or forward) with the Wii Remote, while Kinect takes advantage of the eponymous, 
                camera-based motion controller to grant the player a more fluid, one-to-one control method of swinging the <span class="lightsaber">lightsaber</span>.
