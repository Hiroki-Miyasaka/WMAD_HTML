                <span class="back_1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</span> <span class="art">art</span> uses 
                <span class="red_line">visual language</span> of shape, form, color and line to create a composition which may 
                exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world.[1] <span class="red_line">Western art</span> had been, from the 
                <span class="red_line">Renaissance</span> up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of <span class="red_line">perspective</span> 
                and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a 
                new kind of <span class="art">art</span> which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and 
                philosophy. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social 
                and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.

                <span class="back_2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</span> art, non-figurative art, non-objective art, and 
                non-representational art, are closely related terms. They are similar, but perhaps not of identical meaning.

                <span class="back_3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</span> indicates a departure from reality in depiction of 
                imagery in art. This departure from accurate representation can be slight, partial, or complete. <span class="back_4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</span>ion 
                exists along a continuum. Even <span class="art">art</span> that aims for verisimilitude of the highest degree can be said to be <span class="back_2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</span>, 
                at least theoretically, since perfect representation is impossible. Artwork which takes liberties, altering for instance color 
                and form in ways that are conspicuous, can be said to be partially <span class="back_2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</span>. 
                Total Abstraction bears no trace of any reference to anything recognizable. In geometric <span class="back_4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</span>ion, for in

                Much of the <span class="art">art</span> of earlier cultures - signs and marks on pottery, textiles, and 
                inscriptions and paintings on rock - used simple, geometric and linear forms which might have had a symbolic or 
                decorative purpose.[5] It is at this level of visual meaning that <span class="back_1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</span> 
                <span class="art">art</span> communicates.[6] One can enjoy the beauty of Chinese calligraphy or Islamic calligraphy without 
                being able to read it.
