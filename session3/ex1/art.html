                <span class="back_1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</span> <span class="art">art</span> uses 
                <span class="red_line">visual language</span> of shape, form, color and line to create a composition which may 
                exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world.[1] <span class="red_line">Western art</span> had been, from the 
                <span class="red_line">Renaissance</span> up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of <span class="red_line">perspective</span> 
                and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a 
                new kind of <span class="art">art</span> which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and 
                philosophy. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social 
                and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.

                <span class="back_2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</span> art, non-figurative art, non-objective art, and 
                non-representational art, are closely related terms. They are similar, but perhaps not of identical meaning.

                <span class="back_3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</span> indicates a departure from reality in depiction of 
                imagery in art. This departure from accurate representation can be slight, partial, or complete. <span class="back_4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</span>ion 
                exists along a continuum. Even <span class="art">art</span> that aims for verisimilitude of the highest degree can be said to be <span class="back_2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</span>, 
                at least theoretically, since perfect representation is impossible. Artwork which takes liberties, altering for instance color 
                and form in ways that are conspicuous, can be said to be partially <span class="back_2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</span>. 
                Total Abstraction bears no trace of any reference to anything recognizable. In geometric <span class="back_4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</span>ion, for in

                Much of the <span class="art">art</span> of earlier cultures - signs and marks on pottery, textiles, and 
                inscriptions and paintings on rock - used simple, geometric and linear forms which might have had a symbolic or 
                decorative purpose.[5] It is at this level of visual meaning that <span class="back_1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</span> 
                <span class="art">art</span> communicates.[6] One can enjoy the beauty of Chinese calligraphy or Islamic calligraphy without 
                being able to read it.

                Patronage from the church diminished and private patronage from the public became more capable of providing a 
                livelihood for artists.[12][13] Three <span class="art">art</span> movements which contributed to the development 
                of <span class="back_1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</span> <span class="art">art</span> were Romanticism, 
                Impressionism and Expressionism. Artistic independence for artists was advanced during the 19th century. An 
                objective interest in what is seen, can be discerned from the paintings of John Constable, J M W Turner, Camille 
                Corot and from them to the Impressionists who continued the plein air painting of the Barbizon school.

                Early intimations of a new <span class="art">art</span> had been made by James McNeill Whistler who, in his 
                painting Nocturne in Black and Gold: The falling Rocket, (1872), placed greater emphasis on visual sensation than 
                the depiction of objects. Even earlier than that, with her 'spirit' drawings, Georgiana Houghton's choice to work 
                with <span class="back_3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</span> shapes correlate with the unnatural nature of her 
                subject, in a time when <span class="back_2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</span>ion" isn't yet a concept 
                (she organized an exhibit in 1871).

            In Chinese painting, <span class="back_5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</span> can be traced to the Tang dynasty painter 
            Wang Mo (王墨), who is credited to have invented the splashed-ink painting style.[8] While none of his paintings remain, 
            this style is clearly seen in some Song Dynasty Paintings. The Chan buddhist painter Liang Kai (梁楷, c. 1140-1210) applied 
            the style to figure painting in his "Immortal in splashed ink" in which accurate representation is sacrificed to enhance 
            spontaneity linked to the non-rational mind of the enlightened.<span class="green_back">A late Song painter named Yu Jian, 
            adept to Tiantai buddhism, created a series of splashed ink landscapes that eventually inspired many Japanese Zen painters. 
            His paintings show heavily misty mountains in which the shapes of the objects are barely visible and extremely simplified. 
            This type of painting was continued by Sesshu Toyo in his later years.</span>
