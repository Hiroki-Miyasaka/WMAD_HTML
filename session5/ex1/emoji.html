            <p>Gene is an exuberant emoji 😁 who was born without a filter. Because of this, he is able to take the appearance of multiple different standard emoji 😄 s. In the beginning of the movie, he is shown to be unable to control this, yet later in the movie he has control over his quirk. He is shown right-handed when he tries to write on Spam, the white envelope who thinks about sales to trick others.</p>

            <p>Smiler is the main antagonist in the emoji 🙂 ‚ Movie. She is the system supervisor of the company and was voiced by Maya Rudolph.

            <p>
                Talk about a cast of characters! Our team built over 300 unique emoji😄, troll, pirate, and virus characters.<br>
                The typical time to rig a unique character is extensive, but our rigging supervisor worked with our development team to devise 'smart' rigging systems. Our AutoRig tool was developed for The emoji😄 Movie to create quick procedural rigs on diverse secondary characters, based on factors in the model that the code can analyze. Characters like Pizza, Donut, Bathtub, Christmas Tree, and many others were rigged in a fraction of the time it typically takes.
