                    The Ocean (also the Sea or the world Ocean) is the body of salt water that covers approximately 70.8% of the surface of Earth and contains 97% of Earth's water. An Ocean can 
                    also refer to any of the large bodies of water into which the world Ocean is conventionally divided. Separate names are used to identify five different areas of the Ocean: Pacific 
                    (the largest), Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic (the smallest). Sea water covers approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) of the planet. The Ocean is the 
                    principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, and therefore integral to life on Earth. Acting as a huge heat reservoir, the Ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon 
                    cycle, and the water cycle.<br>
                    Oceanographers divide the Ocean into different vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone consists of the water column from 
                    surface to Ocean floor throughout the open Ocean. The water column is further categorized in other zones depending on depth and on how much light is present. The photic zone 
                    includes water from the surface to a depth of 1% of the surface light (about 200 m in the open Ocean), where photosynthesis can occur. This makes the photic zone the most 
                    biodiverse. Photosynthesis by plants and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) creates organic matter using light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients. Ocean 
                    photosynthesis creates 50% of the oxygen in earth's atmosphere. This upper sunlit zone is the origin of the food supply which sustains most of the Ocean ecosystem. Light only 
                    penetrates to a depth of a few hundred meters; the remaining Ocean below is cold and dark. The continental shelf where the Ocean approaches dry land is more shallow, with a 
                    depth of a few hundred meters or less. Human activity has a greater impact on the continental shelf.

                    The terms "the Ocean" or "the Sea " used without specification refer to the interconnected 
                    body of salt water covering the majority of the Earth's surface. It includes the Atlantic, 
                    Pacific, Indian, Southern and Arctic Oceans. As a general term, "the Ocean" and "the Sea " 
                    are often interchangeable, although speakers of British English refer to "the Sea " in all 
                    cases, even when the body of water is one of the Oceans.<br>
                    Strictly speaking, a "Sea " is a body of water (generally a division of the world Ocean) 
                    partly or fully enclosed by land. The word "Sea " can also be used for many specific, much 
                    smaller bodies of Sea water, such as the North Sea or the Red Sea . There is no sharp 
                    distinction between Sea s and Oceans, though generally Sea s are smaller, and are often
                    partly (as marginal Sea s) or wholly (as inland Sea s) bordered by land.
